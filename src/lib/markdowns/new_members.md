This process is now simpler than ever! Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Fork this repo. Remember to rename it and such!

    <a class="btn" href="https://github.com/Amp-Lab-at-VT/SampleProject/fork" >Sample Project</a>

2. Clone the repo locally, edit the files, and push it to Github. If you are unsure about a section, skip it and your mentor will discuss it with you when it comes time! At the very least, please include a project description

3. Include the link to the forked repo in this form:

    <a class="btn" href="https://forms.gle/XZtVwm5prgZkJmnF6" >Sign up for the Amp Lab</a>

4. Wait for AMP lab staff to reach out to you about your project!

**Too confusing?** We get it, git isn't an easy thing to master. Check <a href = "/beginners_guide">this tutorial</a> to get started without having to clone the repo locally.
