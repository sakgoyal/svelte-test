## About Us
The Autonomous Mastery Prototyping Laboratory or "AMP Lab" is a co-curricular educational lab within the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of Virginia Tech. The AMP lab is student-run and student-led.

Our purpose is to provide a creative, hands-on learning environment for ECE students, staff, and faculty. Through projects, members are able to create anything they can think of and gain important skills for the future.

## How does it work?
AMP Lab members create their own projects that they want to do. Members find a mentor in the lab that has the skills to assist them in the design, construction, and testing of the project. Most of the parts and services are paid for by the ECE department; these are justified using the Educational Value Added by each project.

Many of our members have received internship and full-time positions because of their experiences in the AMP Lab.
