### Advanced Soldering

In the ECE Integrated Design Studio, Bob has created an advanced surface-mount soldering facility. 

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic soldering certification.

- Steady hands. Good eye-hand coordination. Ability to coordinate your fingers' motions with the results displayed on a large monitor connected to a microscope. 

- Patience and good attention to detail.

#### Advanced Soldering Training Info
Bob has designed a surface-mount soldering qualifier board. This board covers:

- SOIC-8, 1.27 mm pitch

- TSSOP-8, 0.65 mm pitch

- VSSOP-8, 0.5 mm pitch

- SOT-23-5, 0.95 mm pitch

- QFP-44-10x10, 0.8 mm pitch

- QFP-100-12x12, 0.4 mm pitch

- QFN-20-5x5, 0.65 mm pitch

- QFN-20-4x4, 0.5 mm pitch

- QFN-20-3x3, 0.4 mm pitch

- 1206 resistors (3216 metric) 3.2 x 1.6 mm

- 0805 resistors (2012 metric) 2.0 x 1.25 mm

- 0603 resistors (1608 metric) 1.6 x 0.8 mm

- 0402 resistors (1005 metric) 1.0 x 0.5 mm

Those who complete the advanced surface-mount certification will be strongly encouraged to mentor others who wish to master surface-mount prototype soldering.
