# Have an idea for a ECE project and want to build it for free?

The Autonomous Mastery Prototyping (AMP) Lab is a lab space that gives electrical and computer engineering students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience and apply what they've learned in class with fun, hands-on projects. 

Projects are chosen and created by the student, and are funded completely by the department! 

## Any ECE student of any grade level can join!

Come join us for a fun time in the Amp Lab:
